# LutronCasetaLeap

[![verified-by-homebridge](https://badgen.net/badge/homebridge/verified/purple)](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Verified-Plugins)

This is a plugin that interfaces between Homebridge (and HomeKit) and the [Lutron CasÃ©ta Smart Bridge](https://www.casetawireless.com/products/expansion-kits-and-smart-bridge). Specifically, this adds support for:

* the [Serena Smart Wood Blinds](https://www.serenashades.com),
* some [Pico Remotes](https://www.lutron.com/en-US/Products/Pages/Components/PicoWirelessController/Models.aspx); more can be added, I just don't own them.

Because HomeKit control for dimmers and switches, etc, are natively supported by the Smart Bridge, this plugin doesn't implement them. If you want to help out and add support, please see the [To-do and contributions](#to-do-and-contributions) section at the bottom of this document.

This is specifically _not_ for the Smart Bridge Pro, which uses (can use) an entirely different protocol. This plugin makes use of the [lutron-leap-js](https://github.com/thenewwazoo/lutron-leap-js) library, which implements the Lutron LEAP protocol, used by the Lutron mobile apps. If it works with the Pro, that's basically just a happy accident. :D

## Preparation

### Get your bridge ID

The bridge ID is the serial number, and is printed on the underside of the bridge, indicated here in green:

### Get your bridge credentials

The easiest way is to use the [`get_lutron_cert.py`](https://github.com/gurumitts/pylutron-caseta/blob/dev/get_lutron_cert.py) script that comes with the [`pylutron-caseta`](https://github.com/gurumitts/pylutron-caseta) project, without which this would not have been possible.

To use the script, you'll want to check out the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/gurumitts/pylutron-caseta.git
```

Then, create a venv and install the depedencies:
```
python3 -m venv env
. env/bin/activate
pip install .
```

Then run the helper script:
```
python get_lutron_cert.py
```

Each file corresponds to a configuration item:
* `caseta-bridge.crt` => CA certificate
* `caseta.key` => Private key
* `caseta.crt` => Signed certificate

## Installation

Either run `npm -i homebridge-lutron-caseta-leap` in your Homebridge installation directory or install it using [`homebridge-config-ui-x`](https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-config-ui-x#readme).

## Configuration

Each bridge on your network that you wish to control needs its own configuration entry.

### Using `homebridge-config-ui-x`

If you're using the GUI, you'll want to fill out the form, copying and pasting in the appropriate fields:

The UI will handle multi-line input, so just paste it in.

Click the "ADD SECRETS" button to add additional bridges.

### Using `config.json`

The shape of the configuration is:

```json
{
    "platform": "LutronCasetaLeap",
        "secrets": [
            {
                "bridgeid": "0a1b2c3d",
                "ca": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMII...",
                "key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII...",
                "cert": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMII..."
            },
            { ... }
        ]
}
```

The authn strings are newline-escaped versions of the files you generated.

## Enabling debugging

In order to enable debugging, set the DEBUG environment variable in the Homebridge UI to `leap:*`. This will make this plugin, and its main library `lutron-leap-js` noisier.

## To-do and contributions

I welcome contributions! I wrote this to scratch an itch (no Serena wood blind support), but would be fine with additional devices. To add a device:
* Add a case to `LutronCasetaLeap.configureAccessory` and `handleBridgeDiscovery` for your new device type.
* Add a class for your device. The constructor should wire up event handlers and manage services and characteristics.
* Add relevant methods to the [`SmartBridge`](https://github.com/thenewwazoo/lutron-leap-js/blob/main/src/SmartBridge.ts) class in the `lutron-leap-js` project to control the device. These methods should construct command requests.
* Add an "unsolicited events" handler in your new device class to update itself when new information arrives from the bridge, and to update characteristic values.

## Development setup

(rough notes)

* Check this out
* Check out the lutron-leap-js repo
* Make changes there and `npm run build` it
* `npm install ../lutron-leap-js`
* Make changes here
* `rm ~/.homebridge/accessories/cachedAccessories; DEBUG='leap:*,HAP-NodeJS:Accessory' npm run watch`
* `npm run lint`
